                <p>DuongLab is a research group located at the Université du Québec
                    à Trois-Rivières, at the Hydrogen Research Institute. Founded 
                    in 2014 by Professor Adam Duong, the group is interested in
                    design, synthesis and characterizations of materials for the
                    development of sustainable energies. Two central issues is
                    addressed in our work: energy conversion and storage.<br/><br/>

                    The group is working on the synthesis of novel materials to
                    improve the current energy technologies. Particularly involved
                    in the design of materials for batteries, DuongLab also seeks
                    to address the problems of storage and synthesis of gas from
                    the properties of materials.<br/><br/>
                    
                    During many decades, scientists have attempted to prepare 
                    three-dimensional, two-dimensional structures in order to induce
                    properties to materials. DuongLab offers innovative synthetic 
                    methods for incorporating and positioning functional groups to 
                    various types of materials such as Covalent Organic Frameworks 
                    (COF), Metal Organic Frameworks (MOF), Hydrogen bounded Organic 
                    Frameworks (HOF).<br/><br/>
                    
                    DuongLab also places at the heart of its concerns the transmission
                    of knowledge. The group constantly seeks to participate in the 
                    training of future generations of researchers, but also to be 
                    part of the scientific community which, through exchanges between
                    its members, allows the expansion of knowledge. DuongLab is
                    involved in teaching and is involve in several center and
                    institut, and has numerous collaborations with other 
                    universities.</p>
